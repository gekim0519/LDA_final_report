#Final Project: Smoking in the Framingham Heart Study

*Target question: *
1)Is there a relationship between age and smoking status?  Does this relationship differ by sex? 

(2)Is there a relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and age?  Does this relationship differ by sex? 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
frmgham = read.csv2("frmgham2.csv", sep=",") %>% clean_names() %>% select(cursmoke, everything())

```

#missing values
```{r}
frmgham %>% 
  group_by(period) %>% 
  summarize(sum_na_period = sum(is.na(period)))

d1 =frmgham %>% 
  group_by(randid) %>% 
  summarize(n=n())
table(d1$n)
#  447 patients have only one obs
#781 patients have only two obs
#3206 patients have all three obs
